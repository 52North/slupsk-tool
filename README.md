# Creating Interfaces - Slupsk Tool

This Citizen Science data collection tool was developed within the [Creating Interfaces](https://creatinginterfaces.eifer.kit.edu/) project and is running with [wq framework].

The project was initialized with

```shell
wq start SlupskTool . -d slupsk-tool.demo.52north.org --with-gis
```

which creates a completely new project based on the [wq standard template].
Note that the command has changed to `wq create` (<https://wq.io/wq.create/create>) in a newer version of wq.

See [Getting Started] for general information on how to build/run a wq-based application.

## How to develop locally

* Clone the git repository: `git clone https://github.com/52North/slupsk-tool.git`.
* Go to project root: `cd slupsk-tool`
* Install Python libraries: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (optionally activate virtual environment before this step)
* Change the file `db/SlupskTool/settings/dev.py` to:

  ```python
  import os
  import sys
  from .base import *
  # SECURITY WARNING: keep the secret key used in production secret!
  SECRET_KEY = <my-secret-key>

  # SECURITY WARNING: don't run with debug turned on in production!
  DEBUG = True

  # wq: Determine if we are running off django's testing server
  DEBUG_WITH_RUNSERVER = 'manage.py' in sys.argv[0]

  ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["localhost"]

  # Database
  # https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/settings/#databases

  DATABASES = {
      'default': {
          'ENGINE': 'django.contrib.gis.db.backends.spatialite',
          'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'conf', 'SlupskTool.sqlite3'),
      }
  }

  SPATIALITE_LIBRARY_PATH = 'mod_spatialite.so'
  ```

* Change the base url in `app/js/SlupskTool/config.js` from `'base_url': '/slupsk-tool'` to `'base_url': ''`
* Change the base url in `db/SlupskTool/context_processors.py` from `return {'rt': '/slupsk-tool'}` to `return {'rt': ''}`
* Change the media url in `db/SlupskTool/settings/base.py` from `MEDIA_URL = '/slupsk-tool/media/'` to `MEDIA_URL = '/media/'`
* Run migrations (create data base tables and prepopulate some of them, e.g. kindergartens/shops) and create superuser via
  `cd db/`
  `./manage.py migrate`
  `./manage.py createsuperuser`
  `cd ..`
* Generate htdocs folder via
  `./deploy.sh 0.0.1`
  Note: the part where templates are updated is commented as this would overwrite changes.
* Run tool on localhost:8000 via
  `./db/manage.py runserver`

### Deployment on a public server
